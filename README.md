==============

An old (now offline) cycling trip planner for Metro Vancouver using MS Access and C#, a project of UBC's Cycling in Cities (http://cyclingincities.spph.ubc.ca/)

This code has been made public for the purposes of code reuse and learning, however our data wasnt fully open, so some files were removed (mostly data). The removal of these files will cause glitches if one clones the code without figuring out the translation of GIS data into its required format for the site (instructions found in DATA folder).
